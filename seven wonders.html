    <h1><b><u>SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD</u></b></h1>
        <ul type="disc" class="intro">
        <li>New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2000 to choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments.</li>
        <li>The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New 
        7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at Est√°dio da Luz.</li>
        <li>The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to cast multiple votes.</li>
        <li>According to John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization Zogby International, New 7 Wonders Foundation drove 
        "the largest poll on record". </li>
        <li>The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get more votes cast for it, while others 
        downplayed or criticized the contest.</li>
        <li>After supporting the New 7 Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign by providing advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational,
        Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), by its bylaws having to record all and give equal status to world heritage sites, distanced itself from the 
        undertaking in 2001 and again in 2007. </li>
        <li>The seven winners were chosen from 21 candidates, which had been whittled down from 77 choices by a panel in 2006.</li>
        </ul>
