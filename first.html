            <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were
            built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian
            Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), 
            the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border
            walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>

            <p>Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the 
            Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the 
            Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or 
            fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.</p>

            <p>The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, 
            from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian
            steppe. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km 
            (5,500 mi). This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive
            barriers such as hills and rivers.[5] Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of its branches measures out to be 21,196 km 
            (13,171 mi). Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p>
